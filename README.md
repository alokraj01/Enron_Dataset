Enron is one of the largest companies to fall due to widespread corporate fraud. Dataset contains financial and email information for its employees or stakeholders. Idea is to identify if a person is involved in fraud or not based on algorithms you develop. 
The project is part of Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Machine learning project.
Implementation:
1) Feature extraction and feature engineering to fill missing values
2) Pipelines to compact the steps
3) GridSearchCV to check the best performing hyperparameters
4) GassianNB,SVM, DecisionTreeClassifier and their performance comparison
